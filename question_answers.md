# Questions and answers for breakout sessions

These questions were posed to attendees as an ice-breaking session. Attendees were broken up into groups of 4-6 people and asked to try to answer a number of questions after introducing themselves to their fellow group members. The questions were:

* [Question 1 - How should we better organise instructors and helpers?](#question-1---how-should-we-better-organise-instructors-and-helpers)
* [Question 3 - How can we broaden the outreach of the initiative?](#question-3---how-can-we-broaden-the-outreach-of-the-initiative)
* [Questions 4 and 2 possible funding streams and sustainability for Edinburgh Carpentries](#questionw-4-and-2-possible-funding-streams-and-sustainability-for-edinburgh-carpentries)
* [Question 5: how to facilitate participation by formally recognise training?](#question-5-how-to-facilitate-participation-by-formally-recognising-training)
* [Question 6: how to engage with decision makers?](#question-6-how-to-engage-with-decision-makers) 

## Question 1 - How should we better organise instructors and helpers?

### Experience of previous events

* Not all instructs had the done the training (in a particular event)
* Software carpentry content is more generabl (and accessible?) to computer scientists while Data Carpentry has more specialised tools.
* There's sometimes too many helpers.
* Currently finding out who will facilitate an  event is like a black box. There's a slack channel.

### Suggestions

* Create a database of helpers (contact details, training, reliability)
* Mailing list (for sending out out formal invittions for specific events)
* Google sheet where people can put their name down for a particular event.
* Keep track of historic data (helpers and instructors for previous events).
* Remember that strictly what is needed for an event is a trained instructor, which helpers don't need to be trained (e.g. informatics students)
* Have more community events.
* Points of contacts in different schools that can help with recruitment/allocation.
* Promote the opportunity to help in the Career Service (e.g. for students).

## Question 3 - How can we broaden the outreach of the initiative?

* Advertising is not particularly problmatic. The problem is to keep people coming or people attending.
* Catering is a good treat to attract people.
* Contact other data workshops and try not to overlap with their workshops (Coding club...). Is our target audience only academics?
* Adding more specialities to appeal to more people. It can be for problematic for admin issues and to build the area-knowledge.
* More advanced workshops would appeal to different audience. It might be difficult to set up material for intermediate and advanced workshops.
   * Person comment: I wanted to learn SQL and had to go through 2 days of R.
* It might be more appealing to do more in-depth and ess diverse workshops (e.g. only SQL, only R).
* Participate in other events: Science Festival (broader audience) or more school specific events.
* Target 1st year PhD students or MSc students or their supervisors. It could be better advertised from schools to their students or Sholarship ... to be mentioned in their introduction week.
* Use a centralised webpage with upcoming events.

## Questionw 4 and 2 possible funding streams and sustainability for Edinburgh Carpentries

  *  Having carpentries be recognised as part of teaching load would be beneficial for
 	sustainability
  *  All agreed that it made most sense for funding to come from departments which benefit from
 	carpentries (i.e. science/engineering)
  *  Possible to get funding from individual departments (schools)? Highest administrative burden,
 	and possibly too University of Edinburgh-centric.
  *  Possible to get funding from national umbrella bodies (i.e. SUPA, SULSA, and equivalents).
 	Lesser administrative burden (fewer bodies to negotiate with) but possibly a harder sell, and
 	might not work if we try and stay within Edinburgh.
  *  Whoever gets asked for funding, they're going to want to see evidence of the effectiveness of
 	carpentries, and the impact on their domain.

## Question 5: how to facilitate participation by formally recognising training?

* People would be encouraged to participate by certificate/award?
* For instructors or students?
* Instructor training £300 2 day course. Demo teaching
* Motivation- to be able to organise and teach a course
* Crowdfound fee/ university central funding? (academic development institute)

* On line/in person course

* Recongnise helpers? 
* BCS external validation or qualification?

* If software/data carpentry well enough known employes to recognise it as an advantage?

* Advance  course development?

* Is portfolio/list of skills more useful that formal recognised qualification

## Question 6: how to engage with decision makers? 

Participants: Mario, Adam, Michael, Nathan.

* Who decides funding?
* Who contributes running budgets?
* Volunteers offer to help/instruct 
* Edinburgh Staff and students: Gold standard $2500 per course with discount if you buy multiple courses and instructors. Don’t help with funding, might have fees in exceptional circumstances

* Key decision makers within Edinburgh Uni:
   * Colleges, schools, Institutes, research councils, WCBI, City deal, ISSK data engineers in 10 years 

* Is it possible to cite data carpentries? 
* Who do put together a grant application? (permanent academic…)

* SSI can provide effort in terms of people not necessarily money
* Have SSI supported carpentries before? Yes

* Organising department will pay expenses for instructor/s
* Course fee
* Instructor/s expenses
* Helpers (minimal expenses if surveyed locally)

* Some journal insist that result are reproducible
